To fix this, we can use file locking to ensure that only one request can access and modify the counter at a time.  This guarantees atomicity and prevents the race condition:
```php
<?php
$counterFile = 'counter.txt';
function updateCounter() {
  global $counterFile;
  // Acquire an exclusive lock on the counter file
  $fp = fopen($counterFile, 'c+');
  if (flock($fp, LOCK_EX)) {
    $counter = (int)file_get_contents($counterFile);
    $counter++;
    ftruncate($fp, 0); // Clear file contents
    fwrite($fp, $counter);
    flock($fp, LOCK_UN); // Release the lock
  } else {
    echo "Could not acquire lock.";
  }
  fclose($fp);
}
//Example usage
updateCounter();
echo file_get_contents($counterFile);
?>
```
This solution uses `flock` to acquire an exclusive lock on the counter file before accessing it. This prevents concurrent modification and ensures that the counter is updated correctly.
